Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you make your own crochet scarf:\r\n\r\nMaterials You’ll Need:\r\nYarn: Choose a yarn that’s suitable for scarves. Worsted weight yarn (medium weight) is a good choice for beginners.\r\nCrochet Hook: Check the yarn label for the recommended hook size. A size H/8 (5mm) hook is common for worsted weight yarn.\r\nScissors: To cut your yarn.\r\nTapestry Needle: For weaving in the ends.\r\nBasic Stitches to Know:\r\nChain (ch)\r\nSingle Crochet (sc)\r\nDouble Crochet (dc)\r\nInstructions:\r\nChoose Your Pattern:\r\n\r\nFor beginners, a simple pattern like single crochet or double crochet throughout the scarf is ideal. You can also try a basic ribbed pattern using alternating rows of single and double crochet.\r\nStart with a Slip Knot:\r\n\r\nMake a slip knot and place it on your hook.\r\nChain the Foundation Row:\r\n\r\nChain a length that will determine the width of your scarf. For a typical scarf, chain about 20-30 stitches.\r\nRow 1:\r\n\r\nSingle Crochet: Insert your hook into the second chain from the hook, yarn over, pull through the loop (two loops on the hook), yarn over, and pull through both loops on the hook. Repeat across the row.\r\nDouble Crochet: Yarn over, insert your hook into the third chain from the hook, yarn over, pull through the loop (three loops on the hook), yarn over, pull through the first two loops, yarn over, and pull through the remaining two loops. Repeat across the row.\r\nRow 2 and Beyond:\r\n\r\nTurn your work and chain 1 (for single crochet) or chain 3 (for double crochet).\r\nSingle Crochet: Insert your hook into the first stitch, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through both loops. Repeat across the row.\r\nDouble Crochet: Yarn over, insert your hook into the first stitch, yarn over, pull through, yarn over, pull through the first two loops, yarn over, pull through the remaining two loops. Repeat across the row.\r\nRepeat Rows:\r\n\r\nContinue working row by row, turning your work at the end of each row and chaining 1 (for single crochet) or chaining 3 (for double crochet) to start the new row.\r\nFinishing:\r\n\r\nOnce your scarf reaches the desired length (typically around 60 inches), finish your last row and cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch tail. Pull the tail through the last loop to secure it.\r\nWeave in Ends:\r\n\r\nUse a tapestry needle to weave in any loose ends neatly into the stitches of the scarf.\r\nOptional: Adding Fringe\r\nCut several pieces of yarn to twice the desired length of the fringe.\r\nFold each piece in half and use your crochet hook to pull the folded end through a stitch at the end of the scarf, creating a loop.\r\nPull the loose ends through the loop and tighten.\r\nTips:\r\nGauge: Check your gauge by making a small swatch to ensure your stitches are even and the width of your scarf is as desired.\r\nPractice: If you’re new to crochet, practice the basic stitches before starting your scarf.\r\nPattern Variations: Experiment with different stitch patterns once you’re comfortable with the basics.\r\nEnjoy your crocheting! With practice, you’ll find it easier and might want to try more complex patterns and projects.',NULL),(9,'DIY Candle','../static/images/DIYCandles.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrE-dw1FyCA','Making candles at home is a fun and creative activity. Here\'s a step-by-step guide to help you create your own candles:\r\n\r\nMaterials You\'ll Need:\r\nWax: Paraffin, soy, or beeswax are common choices.\r\nWicks: Pre-tabbed wicks are easy to use.\r\nContainers: Glass jars, tins, or any heat-safe container.\r\nDouble Boiler: To melt the wax safely.\r\nThermometer: To monitor the temperature of the wax.\r\nFragrance Oils (optional): For scented candles.\r\nDye (optional): For colored candles.\r\nStirring Utensil: A wooden or metal spoon.\r\nWick Holder: To keep the wick centered while the wax hardens.\r\nGlue Dots (optional): To secure the wick to the bottom of the container.\r\nInstructions:\r\nPrepare Your Containers:\r\n\r\nClean your containers and ensure they are dry.\r\nAttach the wick to the bottom of the container using a glue dot or a drop of melted wax. Center the wick using a wick holder or a pencil laid across the top of the container.\r\nMeasure the Wax:\r\n\r\nEstimate the amount of wax needed by filling your container with water, then measure that amount in wax. Add a little extra to account for shrinkage.\r\nMelt the Wax:\r\n\r\nUse a double boiler to melt the wax. Place water in the bottom pot and the wax in the top pot. Heat gently and monitor the temperature with a thermometer.\r\nMelt the wax to the recommended temperature (typically around 170-180°F for most waxes).\r\nAdd Fragrance and Dye (optional):\r\n\r\nOnce the wax is melted, remove it from the heat.\r\nAdd fragrance oil (usually about 1 oz per pound of wax) and stir thoroughly.\r\nAdd dye, if desired, and mix well to achieve an even color.\r\nPour the Wax:\r\n\r\nAllow the wax to cool slightly to around 150-160°F before pouring.\r\nPour the wax slowly into your container, being careful to keep the wick centered.\r\nLet the Candle Set:\r\n\r\nAllow the candle to cool and harden completely. This can take several hours.\r\nIf you notice the wax sinking in the center, you can reheat and add more wax to top it off.\r\nTrim the Wick:\r\n\r\nOnce the candle is fully set, trim the wick to about 1/4 inch.\r\nTips:\r\nSafety First: Always melt wax using a double boiler to prevent overheating and potential fires.\r\nExperiment: Try different types of wax, wicks, containers, and scents to find your favorite combinations.\r\nLabeling: If you make several types of candles, consider labeling them with the scent and type of wax used.\r\nEnjoy your homemade candles! They make great gifts and add a personal touch to your home decor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(24,'Scented Candles ','../static/images/scentedcandle.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAh9lQmaEvI','Materials you will need to make candles\r\nHere’s an overview of the supplies you’ll need to make homemade container candles:\r\n\r\nWax. Candle wax typically comes in wax shavings or wax flakes, which can be purchased in bulk online or from your local craft store. Paraffin wax and natural waxes like beeswax and soy wax are all popular choices.\r\nWicks. Every candle needs a wick. Wicks are typically made of paper, cotton, zinc, or wood.\r\nFragrance oils. Scented candles get their fragrance from essential oils or fragrance oils, which are added to the melted wax during the candle-making process.\r\nSpatula. A heat-proof spatula for stirring wax will ensure an even melt.\r\nHeat-proof container. Mason jars, glass jars, or even tin cans make excellent candle containers. The larger the container, the larger your candle will be.\r\nDouble boiler. Double boilers are kitchen tools that evenly distribute stovetop heat for controlled warming—and they’re perfect for melting wax. You can use a store-bought double boiler or make one by placing a metal bowl on top of a pot with a small amount of water in the bottom.\r\nThermometer. Use a candy thermometer, a digital infrared thermometer, or a deep-fry thermometer to measure the temperature of your wax.\r\nPopsicle sticks or pencils. To stabilize the wick during the curing process, you will need Popsicle sticks, pencils, chopsticks, or other lightweight, straight objects.\r\nPaper towels. Don’t get wax on all of your kitchen towels! Paper towels are ideal for cleaning up wax drips.\r\n10 steps to make candles\r\nPrep containers and supplies\r\nMeasure the wax\r\nMelt the wax\r\nAdd your fragrances\r\nPlace the wick\r\nStabilize the wick\r\nPour the wax\r\nClean up\r\nWait for the candle to cure\r\nLight your candle\r\nMaking candles at home requires a few specialized items, some planning, and a little bit of time—but it’s simpler than you might think. Here’s a step-by-step guide to the candle-making process.\r\n\r\n1. Prep containers and supplies\r\nYou can purchase votive holders or specific candle jars from a craft store, but empty Mason jars or even tin cans will also work. Just make sure you like the look of the vessel—most poured candles cannot be transferred out of their container prior to burning.\r\n\r\nMake sure that your candle containers are clean and dry, and place them on a flat surface. Keep your wicks, fragrance oils, and Popsicle sticks, chopsticks, or other wick holders nearby.\r\n\r\n2. Measure the wax\r\nMeasure your wax by pouring wax flakes or wax shavings into your candle containers, which act as your candle molds. Because shavings take up more space than melted wax, use approximately two candle containers worth of flakes per candle.\r\n\r\n3. Melt the wax\r\nPour your wax shavings or flakes into your double boiler and slowly warm the wax, using your spatula to carefully stir the melting wax and catch any bits that rise up the edges of the pot.\r\n\r\nParaffin wax melts at around 100 degrees Fahrenheit, soy wax melts at approximately 124 degrees Fahrenheit, and beeswax melts at around 145 degrees Fahrenheit. Use your candy thermometer to monitor the temperature.\r\n\r\n4. Add your fragrances\r\nIf you are making scented candles, now is the time to get creative. You can use single-note fragrances (like bergamot, mandarin, or rosemary) with one scent, pre-blended fragrance oils (like sea breeze or apple pie), or make your own combinations (like rose patchouli or lavender sage).\r\n\r\nSome fragrance oils are specifically designed for candle making. For these, follow the instructions on the packaging. If you are using essential oils, add 30 to 40 drops of oil per eight ounce candle. Add the oils slowly and stir with your spatula.\r\n\r\n5. Place the wick\r\nPlace one wick in each candle container. Seal the wick to the center bottom of the jar by placing a drop of wax (or a drop of Super Glue) on the bottom of the wick and letting it dry on the bottom of the jar. For an even burn, make sure the base of the wick is centered in the container.\r\n\r\n6. Stabilize the wick\r\nBefore you pour the wax, place two Popsicle sticks across the top of the jar, sandwiching the wick between them. This will keep the wick upright as the wax hardens. You can also use chopsticks, pencils, or even butter knives—just be careful not to drip too much wax on them in the process.\r\n\r\n7. Pour the wax\r\nCarefully pour the wax, filling the candle container to just below the top of the rim. Pour slowly to minimize air bubbles.\r\n\r\n8. Clean up\r\nDried wax can be tricky to clean up. Wipe up any melted wax drips on your work surface or the outside of the candle mold with paper towels. Hot water can be used to clean up hardened wax spills.\r\n\r\n9. Wait for your candle to cure\r\nSoy candles will harden to room temperature in about four hours and completely cure in three to four days. Paraffin wax candles cure faster (in about two days), and beeswax candles take up to 10 days to cure completely. Once the candle is dry, you can remove the chopsticks and trim your wick.\r\n\r\nIf your candle has dried with pockmarks or indentations in the surface—typically caused by air bubbles rising during the drying process—warm a little bit more wax and add a thin layer on top.\r\n\r\n10. Light your candle\r\nLight ’em up and let ’em burn! Candles make great gifts or online store items, and are a cost-effective way to achieve a beautifully lit, aromatherapy-infused home.',NULL),(25,'Home Made Bath Bombs','../static/images/BathBomb.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_YeSGiNUoQ','Materials: Baking soda, citric acid, Epsom salts, cornstarch, water, essential oils, food coloring, molds.\r\nInstructions: Mix the dry ingredients in a bowl.
